# Motion_Detection_Arduino
Simple piece of code to run a TFlite model on Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense.

Script description as follows: 

1. Data_Acquisition_Arduino: Code to read and save the data from Arduino Nano.

2. Data_Visualization: Script for simple visualization of data

3. ML_Model: Training the model and convertion to tflite file. 

4. GyroAcq is the embedded C putting the MCU in acquisition mode
